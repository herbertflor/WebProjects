Poetry is a form of literary expression that uses language in a creative and aesthetic way to convey meaning, emotion, and imagery. Poetry can be written in various forms, such as sonnets, haikus, free verse, blank verse, etc. Poetry can also employ various devices, such as rhyme, rhythm, meter, alliteration, assonance, consonance, etc. Poetry can be distinguished from prose by its use of line breaks, which create a visual structure and a musical quality. Poetry can be read aloud or silently, and can be interpreted in different ways by different readers. Poetry is an ancient and universal art form that has been used for various purposes, such as entertainment, education, communication, persuasion, commemoration, celebration, etc. Poetry is a valuable and enriching part of human culture and experience.<br><br>

				<hp5>
One of the main differences between poetry and prose is the use of form and structure. Poetry is typically written in lines and stanzas, with attention to rhyme, rhythm, meter, and other literary devices. Prose, on the other hand, is written in sentences and paragraphs, with more focus on the meaning and logic of the text. Poetry often uses figurative language, imagery, and symbolism to convey emotions and ideas, while prose tends to be more literal and straightforward. Poetry also has a variety of genres and subgenres, such as sonnets, haikus, elegies, and epics, each with its own rules and conventions. Prose can also be classified into different types, such as fiction, nonfiction, essays, and novels, depending on the purpose and content of the writing.<br><br>
